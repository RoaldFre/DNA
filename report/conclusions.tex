\section{Conclusions}

Time scaling behavior of hairpin formation by single stranded DNA structures was simulated with a coarse grained model modeling the DNA structure with three sites (base, sugar, phosphate) per nucleotide. The more complex model yields a departure in the time scaling behavior from earlier, more simple simulations. We find that the time scale of zipping of ssDNA hairpins behaves like
\begin{equation}
\tau_\text{zipping} \sim N^{\beta_z} \qquad \qquad \text{with}\ \beta_z = 1.2
\end{equation}
in function of the stem length $N$, where other authors found time scales with exponent  $\beta_z = 1.37 \pm 0.02$.

The unzipping of DNA hairpins is found to have a timescale yielding
\begin{equation}
\tau_\text{unzipping} \sim N^{\beta_u} \qquad \qquad \text{with}\ \beta_u = 2.6,
\end{equation}
where previous simulations by other authors yielded ranges $\beta_u = 2.26(2) - 2.57(3)$ with the more complex older model having lower exponent values than more simple models. Surprisingly, our simulations thus seem to agree more with the simple Monte Carlo simulations.
