\section{Methods}

Full atom simulations of DNA molecules exist (\todo{: citations} \todo{CHARMM, AMBER, LAMMPS, zie citaties is knotts en zijn intro}) but are computationally very heavy. In 2007, the group of De Pablo \cite{knotts2007coarse} applied the technique of coarse graining to a molecular simulation of DNA: instead of simulating all atoms, a DNA monomer is represented by three sites or `beads': the sugar, the phosphate and the base. For simulations where one is mainly interested in the timescale behaviour or global dynamics of the DNA molecule this is a very good approximation: it is computationally cheap (and easy to optimize) while describing the DNA helical structure quite good. 

We implemented the 3SPN model with a few changes of our own(\todo{SPECIFY?}). The codebase was not available publicly, so everything had to be created from scratch in C with an OpenGL rendering engine attached --- we decided to make it open source and available at GitHub: \href{https://github.com/RoaldFre/DNA}{github.com/RoaldFre/DNA}. The interested reader can find the full package containing everything needed to reproduce the material presented in this paper at that location.
